A real-time traffic monitoring system that collects data from roadside sensors, CCTV cameras, and GPS devices. It aggregates this data to detect congestion, suggest alternate routes, and inform emergency response units. The system should support real-time alerts, dashboard visualization, and integration with municipal databases. Performance, scalability, and responsiveness are critical due to high-volume, time-sensitive data streams.
