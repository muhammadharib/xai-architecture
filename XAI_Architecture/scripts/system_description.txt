A mobile health monitoring application that collects biometric data from wearable devices, such as heart rate, sleep cycles, and step counts. The system should track anomalies, provide weekly health summaries, and offer fitness recommendations. It should sync with cloud storage, enable personalized goal-setting, and support offline functionality for remote areas. Data privacy, energy efficiency, and device interoperability are critical concerns.
