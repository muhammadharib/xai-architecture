**Solution:**

The predicted architecture for the described system is **Event-Driven**.

This is supported by the contribution of key semantic dimensions from the requirement embeddings, such as dimension 0, dimension 1, dimension 2, dimension 3, which reflect patterns in the system’s need for user interaction, data processing, and flexibility.

The system must handle frequent user input, real-time financial updates, and modular insights — making Event-Driven a suitable choice due to its ability to support responsive interfaces and maintainable component boundaries.

This architecture aligns with the system’s functional and non-functional goals.
